VIET Events Reborn is the reboot of the Events module from the VIET mod (once part of HIP) that I created over six years ago before I retired three years back. Features include:

[LIST]
[*]Hundreds of new flavor events and event chains that add immersion and a diversity of experiences to your playthroughs, ranging from small talk with courtiers and eating local cuisine to epic tales about love, philosophy, and the human condition
[*]Game rules to disable sillier events for those who don't like them, with three levels to choose from: Balanced (Default), Serious (Restricted), and All Events (Full)
[*]New artifacts to collect and nicknames to acquire from these events
[*]Plenty of new event pictures, including cultural and religious variants of vanilla event pictures
[*]Performance tweaks and miscellaneous improvements over the old VIET Events (many courtesy of the WTWSMS, LI, and Hide Your Jewelry mod teams)
[*]Compatibility with almost everything since it doesn’t touch any vanilla files
[*]French translation available (credits to Loup99, Mouchi, and Domper59)
[*][B]NOT ACHIEVEMENT COMPATIBLE![/B]
[/LIST]

At the moment, the reboot does not include all of the original events. To not overwhelm myself, what I want to do is slowly add the old events in batches so I can fix, tweak, or remove them as I see fit, while also adding in new events for variety. Any input with balance and bugs is much appreciated as I slowly bring VIET back to life! In particular I am still trying to determine a right balance in how often these events fire.

Please feel free to use my work in your mods, all I ask is that I and my old VIET partner Ordep are credited. If you want to use something that I borrowed from someone else, please see the credits section below.

I will also not be rebooting Immersion or Traits at this time, though my Immersion Packs are a spiritual successor to VIET Immersion, so feel free to check out [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1601450410]Cybrxkhan's Immersion Packs[/url], which are a smaller scale, more modular spiritual successor to VIET Immersion.



[h1]Credits[/h1]

A huge thanks to the teams of WTWSMS (especially ILikeTrians and Loup99) and Lux Invicta (including tsf4), as well as M@ni@c, creator of Hide Your Jewelry, for maintaining VIET these past few years and who I reached out to. The improvements these modders did to my old code have formed the basis for this reboot of VIET Events. ILikeTrains has been particularly helpful in catching some issues, and helping me adjust back to CKII modding. The French translation of much of the mod is thanks to Loup99, Mouchi, and Domper59.

Additional credits goes to theStormWeaver who I worked with every now and then during my retirement to add some flavor events to the Ancient Religions Reborn mod, and the inspiration for naming updates after people and stuff.

I also of course want to give big credits to the HIP team, whom I worked with for some time before I retired - in particular OrdepNM, who was in many ways my partner in crime and who stepped up to help maintain my mod while I was having serious medical issues a while back.

Please see the forum thread for the full list of credits.

Version 2.0.3 "Shen Kuo"

[I]Shen Kuo was a Chinese polymath, scholar, and official of the Song Dynasty. Among his many achievements in various fields, he developed an academically rigorous approach to archaeology and history for his time.[/I]

[LIST]
[*]Added 11 Ancient Culture themed events
[*]Added 12 Clutter themed events (to gain even more useless clutter!)
[*]Added 29 events to lose artifacts added in VIET Events - these fire on a separate on_actions and are fairly rare (though will be a little more common for characters with more than three VIET artifacts)
[*]Re-added the following 41 events from old VIET: 7 Ancient Cultures, 9 Sound, 3 Prayer, 9 Memories, 5 Shady, and 8 Comet Events
[*]Re-added event chains: Minotaur and Tarim Basin Scrolls
[*]Added “Clutter” slot in player inventory for the miscellaneous VIET artifacts. Players are now limited to “equipping” three of these at a time, to prevent stacking a crap ton of bonuses.
[*]Added many new clutter artifacts, including some ancient artifacts
[*]Events to gain or lose VIET artifacts are now in a separate on_actions - will still need testing to tweak frequency
[*]Added flags to VIET artifacts
[*]Reduced frequency of VIET artifact events
[*]Reduced chances of getting VIET artifacts if character already has one (via scripted trigger)
[*]Reduced severity of revolt risk for several modifiers
[*]Nutcracker and Hourglass artifact events now moved to the Five year on_actions pulse (where almost all the other clutter artifact events were)
[*]Israelite/Jewish cultures now also count for is_baklava_culture_trigger
[*]Fixed Mysterious Colors, Famous Bard, and Haunted Ship event modifiers giving global revolt risk instead of local revolt risk
[*]Fixed Calipers and Abacus artifact events being able to fire if character already owns them
[*]Fixed event where you go to the ocean at night firing if your capital isn’t coastal
[*]Other miscellaneous fixes

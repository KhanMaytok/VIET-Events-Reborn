VIETmisc.8000.desc;Last night [Root.GetSheHeOpp] appeared in my dream, and we laughed and danced and talked about nothing in particular. My heart was beating so fast, for I was so nervous yet excited that even when I woke up I could still feel it. It has been so long, so many years since we last met, yet even now I still think about [Root.GetHerHimOpp].;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8000.a;We were so young and innocent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8001.desc;I idly sit at court one day when I see one of my young servants staring across the hall at one of my maids for far too long. She notices and looks at him, confused. He immediately jerks his head away, embarrassed, awkwardly avoiding her gaze. It's old news that he finds her attractive but hasn't worked up the courage to tell her, and she is too oblivious to know any better.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8001.a;He will find courage soon, or she a brain. It’ll work out.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8001.b;Silly boy and girl. Fanciful, stupid, fleeting feelings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8001.c;Ah, youth!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8001.d;I sympathize with him. People are scary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8001.b.tooltip;It’s not like I was in love with anyone that way or anything like that.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8002.desc;I don't know why, but I am feeling quite happy and inspired today.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8002.a;It's a good feeling!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8003.desc;I saw a crab in the mud the other day.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8003.a;Horrible creatures! I avoid them whenever I can.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8004.desc;I am in town one day when I hear a guard shout, “STOP, YOU VIOLATED THE LAW!”\n\nWith superhuman speed, he catches a thief and drags the criminal to jail.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8004.a;Most remarkable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8004.b;Impressive. Reward the guard for this.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8004.c;I like him. Why don’t we bring him to my court?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8005.desc;I did not approve of what [target_VIET_inappropriate_courtier.GetFullName] said. It was vulgar and inappropriate for the situation.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8005.a;I made my stance clear. How disappointing!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8005.b;I hinted it might have been unsuitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8005.c;I did not say anything for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8006.desc;A bridge in [Root.GetName] has recently collapsed. As a major thoroughfare connecting various villages in the region, we must fix it as soon as possible.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8006.a;Send in emergency resources immediately!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8006.b;Do whatever is necessary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8006.c;The locals can take care of it themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_bridge_fix_sooner;\nThe bridge is fixed in a quick timeframe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_bridge_fix_okay;\nThe bridge is fixed in a reasonable timeframe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_bridge_fix_bad;\nThe bridge takes a long while to get fixed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8007.desc;The sky over [Root.GetName] turned several colors at once, unnatural hues of purple, red, green, blue, pink, and more. This lasted many days and though there were no known effects, the inhabitants of the region are bewildered. None of the local learned men nor mystics could explain this phenomenon.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8007.a;Who knows what mysterious forces are at play here?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_famous_bard_settles;The bard settles down in your lands.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8008.desc;A famous bard has settled down in [Root.GetName]. Though his music and singing is sublime, he refuses to perform for the wealthy and powerful, even when offered exorbitant amounts of riches. Instead, he prefers to entertain the poor and the masses, inspiring and uplifting them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8008.a;He shall be arrested for his insolence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8008.b;If he wishes to associate with commoners, so be it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8008.c;I can understand his reasons in all honesty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8009.desc;Disturbing reports from [Root.GetName]. A mysterious wooden ship has been spotted floating in the sky along the far horizon in several areas along the coast. The few ships that tried to approach could never reach it, and it does not fly the flag or banner of any known peoples. Wherever it was spotted, locals reported hearing strange, whistling noises, like a faint, screeching wind, in the night for several weeks afterwards.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8009.a;Alarming apparitions….;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8009.b;Probably just some peasant hysteria.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8010.desc;A peasant in [Root.GetName] got lost recently while trekking near the wilderness. She came across a flat, vertical stone surface where the ancient rulers of the region carved various images and inscriptions. After she reported this to the local officials, you sent in people to investigate and it appears this stone is the last remnants of an imposing ancient monument! The stone can’t be re-used, so it must stand where it is, perhaps for all eternity.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8010.a;Quite a sight to behold!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8010.b;Heathen symbol. Discourage people from visiting it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8010.c;This is a holy place - build an altar near it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8010.d;Send a few antiquitarians to study it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8011.desc;A sandstorm recently swept through [Root.GetName] at a most inopportune time. A large number of people perished, including some soldiers who were on patrol. Furthermore, there was some damage to local infrastructure and buildings.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8011.a;Troubling news.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#VIETmisc.8012.desc;[target_VIET_vanished_death_courtier.GetName] was never found. The trail ran cold. As far as anyone knows, [target_VIET_vanished_death_courtier.GetSheHe] either went somewhere without telling anyone or died. But it is odd that [target_VIET_vanished_death_courtier.GetSheHe] wouldn’t have told anyone, so rumor is that [target_VIET_vanished_death_courtier.GetSheHe] died. What a tragedy!;;;;;;;;;;;x
#VIETmisc.8012.a;Let us hope it was nothing serious.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
#VIETmisc.8013.desc;[target_VIET_vanished_death_courtier.GetName] was never found. The trail ran cold. As far as anyone knows, [target_VIET_vanished_death_courtier.GetSheHe] either went somewhere without telling anyone or died. But it is odd that [target_VIET_vanished_death_courtier.GetSheHe] wouldn’t have told anyone, so rumor is that [target_VIET_vanished_death_courtier.GetSheHe] died. What a tragedy!;;;;;;;;;;;x
#VIETmisc.8013.a;What could have happened to them?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8012.desc;You spot two of your courtiers talking one day. Having nothing to do at that particular moment, you walk up to them, but when they notice you they immediately stop their conversation. “Is something wrong?” you ask.\n\n”Nothing,” one of them says, as the other one raises an eyebrow.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8012.a;Suspicious. Very suspicious….;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8012.b;This is awkward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8012.c;Sounds good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8012.d;I’ll apologize - I’m sure they had their reasons.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8013.desc;Someone is asking me for recommendations for good reading. By coincidence, just yesterday I finished reading a wonderful book. I enjoyed it greatly and would recommend to a lot of people. Specifically, the story is a...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8013.a;Sappy, dramatic romance about true love.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8013.b;Gritty, dark tale with bloodshed and deviancy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8013.c;Fantastical adventure to foreign lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8013.d;Collection of amusing anecdotes about daily life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8014.desc;I am entertaining some important members of a nearby city today - they include high ranking officials, merchants, scholars, and more. I notice among them is a young man, handsome and of good heart, yet clearly forlorn and disturbed. “Let him be,” one of his companions whispers to me. “He is melancholy because of a woman!”;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8014.a;What foolishness! I’ll set the lad’s head straight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8014.b;Let me reason with the fellow.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8014.c;What woe! Love is cruel. I can relate to him well.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8014.d;Women? They’re nothing but trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8014.e;I can offer counsel from a lady’s perspective.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8015.tooltip;Perhaps I can help him with his sorrows.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8015.desc;As I chat with the young man, he tries to play coy but can’t deny that his heart is broken. I cannot determine whether because the girl rejected him, is with another man, died, or that some other calamity happened, but it is definite he will never be with her. Clearly he is lovesick, and the girl certainly seems like a really impressive woman worthy of love. What should I tell him?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8015.a;There are many women. Surely you'll meet another!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8015.b;Find a busty wench to satisfy your carnal desires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8015.c;Let your love inspire you to do great things.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8015.d;Spoiled idiot! There are worse problems out there!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8016.desc;You are so dedicated to your work that lately you sometimes take your paperwork with you while you are at the chamberpot. Unfortunately today your hand slipped and the papers fell into the chamberpot itself. These were very important papers, too.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8016.a;I must recover them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8016.b;I think I have learned my lesson about being a workaholic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8016.c;Thankfully I told my scribe to make some copies!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8017.desc;China, that most august empire, has always been a source of rumors of dubious reliability. Lately, traveling merchants and adventurers relay stories about how the current Empress of China is as powerful and fearsome as she is beautiful and charming. She has a strong grip over the Emperor and is the real authority behind everything, even if she only rules from the shadows.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8017.a;A fanciful tale! A joke, even!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8017.b;Stranger things have happened in China.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8017.c;It is good women have more power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8017.d;Tell me more about this great and powerful woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8018.desc;Polo has been popular among the [Culture.GetName] people for many generations. It is no surprise to hear that the people of China also enjoy it. Though women often play polo in many parts of the world, some claim Chinese women as the best polo players in the world! It is said imperial concubines and princesses regularly beat the menfolk of the imperial court at the sport.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8018.a;I wonder what tricks and techniques they use.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8018.b;Ha! As if any woman could do that!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8018.c;Surely our women are just as good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8018.d;I am not a fan of polo either way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8019.desc;The ocean waters rage and rage and rage around you in your dream, a maddening array of the raw force of nature's destruction, and you are unraveled, helplessly, as you are at their mercy. What is humanity but a speck in the cosmos when compared to all this?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8019.a;Even this I shall overcome!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8019.b;We are insignificant to the cosmos.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8019.c;Help! Help! Help!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8020.desc;I am visiting the patricians prominent in a nearby town. One of them, a lovely young lady, is reputedly an excellent musician, and after the main meeting provides some informal entertainment for everyone present with her singing and music. She plays music beautifully and I am captivated by her sounds of her music.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8020.a;How inspiring! How touching!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8020.b;Give her a large tip.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8020.c;I want her to become a musician at my court.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8020.d;I want her at my court, to perform music and other “amusements” for me.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8021.tooltip;\n\nSurely she would not refuse such an opportunity.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8021.desc;The lady tells me such a thing would not be possible. She is about to marry a good young man, and cannot bear to leave him alone. She also wishes to continue living in a more familiar setting.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8021.a;What a pity. I understand, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8021.b;How dare she! It’s her loss.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8021.c;Why doesn't she and her husband to be come to my court?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_offer_money_to_singer;With a generous offer of money, you convince the young couple to come and join your court.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8022.desc;I have heard about people in the eastern realms live on a vegetarian diet. That is, they refuse to consume meat, often for moral or religious reasons. Clearly there are many different customs around the world, but to subsist without any meat for your entire life? Are there people who would go to such extreme lengths for their beliefs? Does their food even taste good?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8022.a;Such restraint is admirable!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8022.b;We were meant to eat meat! Some are prey, others are predators.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8022.c;Only peasants cannot afford meat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8022.d;Those who are [Root.Religion.GetName] already avoid some meats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8022.e;Customs are different all over the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_vegetarian_similarity_to_kosher_halal;Surely avoiding even more meats is not too big a logical jump.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8023.desc;A traveler is regaling me with stories, and one piques my interest. He heard from someone who heard from someone else who heard from someone else who met a traveler who once traveled south along the seas and reached a small but beautiful island, a paradise where there is always fruit to be found on trees, and the inhabitants live peaceful lives free of illness and violence.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8023.a;An unlikely tale, but an amusing one nevertheless.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8023.b;Perhaps one day I shall visited these blessed isles.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8023.c;I wonder how their society is structured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8024.desc;There are those who, after eating, prefer to consume a bit of mint leaves before they clean their teeth in the evening. I have just finished dinner and am preparing for bed, but still have some time to take a bit of mint first. Where do I stand on this important matter?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8024.a;Some mint is good and refreshing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8024.b;I have no need. Teeth cleaning is enough.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8024.c;Bah! Who bothers? A waste of time for the vain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8024.d;I prefer other herbs actually.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8025.desc;I fell asleep and dream pleasant dreams, dreams that were happy and lifted my spirits and made me feel better about life.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8025.a;But then I woke up the next morning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8026.desc;A powerful woman such as myself has many enemies, so I must be constantly surrounded by sturdy, strong bodyguards who will protect me. It helps that many of these young men are well built and aesthetically pleasing. However, some people are spreading malicious rumors, saying these strapping young men are nothing but my lovers!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8026.a;Preposterous. I am not that sort of woman.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8026.b;Admiring eye candy is one thing, actions are another.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8026.c;I can't blame them!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8026.d;The others are jealous of my power.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8027.desc;A young noblewoman has come to me today seeking advice on what sort of man makes a good husband. As a highly respected lady, I command much prestige and she wants my input on the matter. After discussing the best personality and backgrounds, she asked me what sort of man I found aesthetically pleasing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8027.a;I prefer leaner, slimmer types.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8027.b;Those of average build - neither extreme.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8027.c;Only the bulky, muscular kinds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8028.desc;Whispers of the ghost of [Root.GetName] have reached your court. Many sightings have been reported along the cliffs by several coastal villages, of how every evening the faint trace of a ghost appears and gazes into the waters for a few hours before disappearing. The ghost is not malevolent at all, and at most merely points, almost dreamlike, towards something which most likely we cannot see nor understand. A few even claimed that the ghost has guided wayward travelers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8028.a;What a ghost story!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8029.desc;There are scholars who claim that one day, we will be able to make contraptions that allow us to fly like birds. Other thinkers say this is an impossibility.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8029.a;If we can dream it, then it is possible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8029.b;Let us be realistic here - we are not birds.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8029.c;To do so would be an affront to the heavens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8029.d;It is theoretically plausible - physically if we just….;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8030.desc;Although you had a full night's of rest the quality of the sleep must not have been good, because you are feeling drowsy today.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8030.a;I have to stay awake!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8030.b;Maybe a quick nap will do me good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8031.desc;The muscles in my shoulders feel sore all of a sudden.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8031.a;This will be a problem. Ouch!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8032.desc;Today I met some important guests from a distant land, but in the middle of our conversation, I got a most terrible foot cramp! Everyone looked around as I held my foot, groaning in pain. My translator tried to explain to the foreigners what was going on, to which they seemed to understand and awkwardly try to comfort me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8032.a;Why me?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8033.desc;The traveling merchant shows me a so-called hourglass. It is not a particularly common tool, but it can measure time much more accurately than most contemporary methods. Perhaps I should buy one for personal use!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8033.a;And I shall!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8033.b;I have no need.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8034.desc;A farmer was digging near his residence in [Root.GetName] when he found some small ruins from a bygone era. Though these ruins may be of interest to antiquitarians, not much could be found, as it seems looters already took most of the existing valuables over the centuries - except, that is, an ancient clay pot that despite its age and simplicity, still looks beautiful and exquisite. It is clearly the work of a skilled craftsman. The farmer offers it to you, his liege.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8034.a;Good, it’ll make for a nice piece of decoration.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8034.b;Compensate the farmer for his efforts before taking it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8034.c;Nay, the farmer can keep it since he found it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8035.desc;There is a traveling scholar staying at my court for a brief while. He owns many impressive instruments, many which he says would take him too long to explain the purpose of, but a seemingly simple magnifying glass piques your interest, for it has been crafted with care and looks quite nice. The scholar says he is willing to sell you it for a good price before he departs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8035.a;Sounds like a deal!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8035.b;That's fine, I just think it looks nice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8036.desc;I was bored one day and noticed a beautiful looking calliper inside a box. Few are as finely crafted and exquisite in quality, so I asked a maid about it. “Maybe long ago you could find calipers in every household across [Root.Location.GetName], but not anymore,” the maid says, “Especially one of this quality.” As a [Root.GetTitle], I can obviously keep it if I like it, she adds.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8036.a;Why not. It’s beautiful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8036.b;I am a caliper collector.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8037.desc;Chinese travelers are staying at my court. Leading them is the daughter of a Chinese official of the great [offmap_china.GetName]. I wanted to show her my manor or the nearby town, but she insists on exploring the local scenery and ancient ruins. She is adventurous, so say her traveling companions, who seem unaffected by her antics, in contrast with your scandalized courtiers.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8037.a;What a spirited young lady! I like her spark.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8037.b;If she wishes it, I shall oblige.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8037.c;This is inappropriate! Women are weak, and it’s dangerous out there.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8037.d;She is under my protection, so I can’t let her wander off like that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8038.tooltip;\n\nDespite the protests of some of your courtiers, you allow her to go as she wishes. She is clearly no dainty flower!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8038.desc;The young Chinese lady was most impressed with the local surroundings. She tells me her husband is an open-minded scholar and historian back in China, and the two of them enjoy discussing ancient cultures and peoples. She will definitely share her observations with her husband when she returns home, and he will undoubtedly write a glowing account of my realm!;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8038.a;I am flattered!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8039.desc;As night fell, I found myself alone in my chambers. Suddenly - and I don't know how it started - I just began crying. I sobbed for what must have been hours, letting out all my pain and sadness. When it stopped, I felt a little better.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8039.a;But things aren't over. Not yet.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8040.desc;I am drinking an excellently prepared herbal tea made using the horehound herb, said to help with digestion and breathing.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8040.a;Ah! What relaxing tea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8041.desc;For centuries, the peoples of the Balkans have drank so-called mountain tea, made from the sweet tasting ironwort plant. Today I am drinking some to relax.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8041.a;How sweet!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8042.desc;Black tea, also known as red tea, is considered a precious commodity in this part of the world. I have been given several blocks of dried black tea as a gift. They are said to come from China so their quality should be very high, and I can present these to guests at various banquets and functions.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8042.a;Very good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8043.desc;I added too much salt to my food and it now tastes disgusting.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8043.a;Ugh!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8043.b;I will try to eat it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8044.desc;My cook asks me whether I prefer hard-boiled eggs or soft-boiled eggs.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8044.a;Soft.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8044.b;Hard.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8044.c;Whatever my cook prefers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8044.d;I want to abstain from eggs for a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8045.desc;I am attending a ball when I met a most interesting fellow! He introduces himself as “an old sea captain and rover, now a shipowner and fat merchant.” Cheerful and cordial, he offers you some advice: “Go down to the sea, stand a while. Watch the sun rise and set. Think on the distant lands across the water.";;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8045.a;The man is friendly, and the two of you end up talking for quite a while.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8046.desc;While in the middle of reviewing some paperwork, the dust must have gotten to my nose and I sneezed! According to [Root.Culture.GetName] superstition, if one sneezes in the middle of work, it is a bad omen and one must interrupt the flow of work - such as by stopping to drink some water - to prevent any misfortune from happening.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8046.a;Just superstition. Let's continue work.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8046.b;It's silly, but just to be safe I'll drink some water.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8046.c;Oh no! Get me some water, quick!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8047.desc;[Root.Culture.GetName] belief holds it that if one sneezes, it means someone is talking about you behind your back. Sneeze a certain amount of times, and you'll know what they said. One sneeze means good things, two means bad things, and three means they love you. Today, while talking with a number of people, I happened to sneeze very loudly…;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8047.a;One time.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8047.b;Two times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8047.c;Three times.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8048.desc;My chefs prepared an inordinate amount of baklava for a small banquet I was hosting, and I ended up eating most of the baklava! Few could blame me, though - it was very good baklava.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8048.a;I'm sorry about that, but also not sorry.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8049.desc;Recently, pistachios from [Root.GetName] have become very popular in the region. It must be something related to their taste or texture. Exports will likely continue to grow in the coming years.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8049.a;Good to hear!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8050.desc;Some of your courtiers are engaged in an intense debate on which sort of incestuous marriage is the best. Though all are, of course, holy and great deeds any [Root.Religion.GetName] believer can do, there are certainly good points and bad points for each type. You decide to get involved in the conversation - what do you think is the best kind of incestuous marriage?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8050.a;Siblings.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8050.b;Not just any siblings, but twins.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8050.c;Parent and child.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8050.d;Any incest is good!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_incest_debate_choice_bs;Being closer in age, they are more likely to get along with one another and understand things from the other’s perspective.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_incest_debate_choice_tw;Twins are more than brother and sister. They shared a womb, came into this world together, and thus belong together.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_incest_debate_choice_pc;A child must understand the source of their origin, and the creator of life must grow closer to that which they created.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_incest_debate_choice_all;Come on, why must we fight? This is the sort of bickering of fools that will cause unnecessary divisions between all of us.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8051.desc;During the day, I tend to forget the stars. But at night, how they shine! Far away, I cannot reach them.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8051.a;But I still watch the stars, longing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8052.desc;Before me is an endless expanse of grass and the sunset sky colored in pastel shades of rose and gold. A single tree is all there exists. I sit under the tree, and the wind faintly whispers in my ear, singing of the joys and sorrows of the ancients. It gently sways the tree, and shadows of the branches and leaves dance over my face.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8052.a;I wake up from the dream, and feel at peace.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8053.title;Through the Valleys;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8053.desc;When I fell asleep and traveled to the land of dreams, I found myself on a vast hill of the greenest grass, overlooking a great lake surrounding a mighty city. Below the hill was an ancient marble shrine, while behind me was a small cottage beside a forest, where birds whistled and the trees whispered comfort in my ear. I rested for a while before I decided to...;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8053.a;Walk down the hill, to see the lake.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8053.b;See the shrine to pay my respects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8053.c;Explore the forest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8053.d;Enter the cottage and relax.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8054.title;Harvest Dawn;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8054.desc;I emerge from my residence early in the morning to travel to an important noble’s residence some distance from here. Along the way, as the sun slowly crept upwards into the sky, I pass by several villages. Peasants scatter themselves in the fields, working with their crops, though they always stop to pay their respects to me.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8054.a;Good to see all is in order.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8054.b;Those commoners scare me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8054.c;I want to ask some of them about how things are going.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8055.title;King and Country;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8055.desc;I realize that there must have been many rulers who came before me, lesser lords and ladies, as well as mighty kings and queens, who once ruled this country. Many of them I will never know. Will I, too, be forgotten one day, not even a footnote in a history book nor even a faint whisper in the wind?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8055.a;Even if I die, what matters is if I did my duty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8055.b;I will do great deeds to ensure my immortality!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8055.c;As long as I'm happy, then I am fine with whatever happens.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8055.d;Nothing matters in the end. Why do I even try?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8056.title;Wings of [Root.Religion.GetRandomGodName];;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8056.desc;I am in another dream again - this time, I am flying in the sky, looking over a realm of grassy pastures and green forests. There are so many places I can go to, yet one place calls to me, one place where I can’t resist exploring:;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8056.a;The pale, white temple to the north;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8056.b;The cosmopolitan trade port to the west;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8056.c;The mysterious, dark swamp to the south;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8056.d;The vast flower fields to the east;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8057.title;All's Well;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8057.desc;Today was a very quiet and boring day at court. Nothing exciting happened.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8057.a;Excitement isn't always desirable, so I’m glad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8057.b;I want excitement! I want to live life!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_alls_well_type_b;\nPeople always say they want excitement in their lives, but they should wish for good things first - after all, excitement isn’t always good.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIET_alls_well_type_a;\nIndeed, sometimes people always sit around and don’t do anything with their lives. What’s the purpose of living if you don’t explore the world?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8058.title;Watchman's Ease;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8058.desc;“Top of the morning and nothing to report,” the guard told me as I made a few rounds around my garden.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8058.a;Continue as you were.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8058.b;Stand up straight!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8058.c;Why aren't you being more vigilant?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8059.title;Glory of [Root.Capital.GetName];;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8059.desc;There are of course always those who doubt my right to rule this land and claim I am not a rightful [Root.GetTitle]. Yet how can I gaze upon this land of mine, and not see my connection to it? It is my realm too. I have a purpose as its master:;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8059.a;To…. Actually, I’m not too sure if I have a purpose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8059.b;To do with it as I please.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8059.c;To protect and help my subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8059.d;To bring glory to my realm and dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8060.title;Minstrel's Lament;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8060.desc;A musician I hired for a banquet sings a rather sad song. Many in my court are moved deeply by the pathos of the story being told.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8060.a;I, too, shed a tear.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8060.b;I didn't find it that sad.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8061.title;[Root.Religion.GetHighGodName]’s Ascension;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8061.desc;A physical manifestation of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] supposedly appeared in a remote village in [Root.GetName], and blessed a few locals, before ascending into the heavens. Few of the official clergy seem to believe these peasants’ claims, saying it is misunderstandings of the ignorant, but the peasants don’t care and have built altars where these incidents occurred.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8061.a;A good omen! Encourage the clergy to support the village.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8061.b;It was clearly an illusion of [Root.Religion.GetRandomEvilGodName]. Repress the cult!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8061.c;I have no opinion on these peasants’ superstitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8062.title;Dusk at the Market;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8062.desc;I rushed to the local market as the sun was setting, hoping to buy something I really wanted, but the merchant told me he had all run out of that product. “It will be a long time before I can acquire more of it,” he told me apologetically, and even if I were to pay him a lot of money, he won’t be able to get it for me right now.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8062.a;No problem with that! I will wait.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8062.b;That bastard! He’s tricking me!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8062.c;At least he’s honest. Can’t do much now.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8063.title;Sunrise of Flutes;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8063.desc;Today I woke up earlier than usual. Feeling a bit restless, I ventured out of my residence and took a walk outside with some trusted guards. We thought we heard a whistling sound up ahead, and upon further investigation we found out that it was a young shepherd with his flock, playing a pleasant song on his wooden flute. He greets me reverently, and wishes me the best.;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8063.a;Please, play some more music. It’s good.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8063.b;He’s just a peasant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8064.title;Peace of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName];;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8064.desc;There are those who say that according to the [Root.Religion.GetScriptureName], [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] wants all peoples to be at peace with one another. But is that just mere idealism? Can true peace under the wisdom and benevolence of [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] ever be accomplished?;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8064.a;I think [Root.Religion.GetHighGodName] wants us to smite infidels, not to have peace!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8064.b;Love and peace! We are indeed all brothers and sisters!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
VIETmisc.8064.c;It’s a nice idea, but idealism can only do so much.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
